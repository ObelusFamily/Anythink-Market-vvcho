# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup
1. I had to change the version in the docker-compose.yml from 3.8 to 3.3 per a docker-compose error alert.
2. From within the ~\wilco\Anythink.... folder: run docker-compose up -d
3. The git repo sits in the Anything.... folder.
4. Ideally, all git commands will be run from terminal commands to Github.
